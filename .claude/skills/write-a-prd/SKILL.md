name: write-a-prd
description: Create a PRD through user interview and research, then save it as a Markdown file. Use when the user wants to write a PRD, create a product requirements document, or plan a new feature/product.
---

This skill creates a Product Requirements Document (PRD). The PRD covers functional requirements, user flows, UX/UI, personas, and business constraints. Technical architecture, implementation decisions, and testing strategy are NOT part of PRD — they belong in a separate ADR document created in a later step.

You may skip steps below if clearly not applicable, but do not skip the question step.

---

## Process

### Step 1 — Gather initial description
If not already provided, ask the user for a detailed description of the product or feature: what problem it solves, who it's for, and any ideas they already have about how it should work.

### Step 2 — Explore the repo (if applicable)
If this is a feature added to an existing codebase, explore it to understand the current state. Verify the user's assumptions. Do not skip this if there is relevant existing code.

### Step 3 — Ask clarifying questions (REQUIRED)
Ask the user a minimum of 5 clarifying questions before writing anything. Do not start writing the PRD until you have answers.

Cover at minimum:
- Who are the users? Any specific personas or edge cases?
- What happens after the main happy-path action? (e.g., after form submit, after AI decision)
- What are the explicit out-of-scope items for this PoC/MVP?
- What should happen in error and unclear/ambiguous cases?
- Are there any external constraints — legal, API limits, third-party rules, file formats — that need to be validated before writing?
- What does the UI/UX need to look like at a wireframe level?
- If AI/agents are involved: what should the agent do when it cannot make a clear decision? What is it NOT allowed to do?

Walk down each branch of the design tree and resolve dependencies between decisions one by one. Do not proceed until ambiguities are resolved.

### Step 4 — Research external facts (if needed)
If the product involves external APIs, file format constraints, legal requirements, or third-party service limits, research them before writing. Do not put unverified numbers or constraints into the PRD.

### Step 5 — Write the PRD
Use the template below. Save the result as `docs/PRD.md` (or the path the user specifies).

## Rules

- **Language**: Always write the PRD in English, regardless of the language the user communicates in.
- **No marketing language**: No fluff, no "users will be delighted", no vague superlatives. Every sentence must be useful to a developer or agent implementing the product.
- **No technical implementation details**: Do not specify frameworks, libraries, file paths, SDK choices, database schemas, or code patterns. Those belong in the ADR (Architecture Decision Records). Mention functional behavior only.
- **No testing strategy**: Test cases and testing decisions belong in the ADR, not the PRD.
- **Measurable acceptance criteria**: Every AC must be verifiable. "Works correctly" is not an AC. "Returns HTTP 400 with error message if file exceeds 10 MB" is.
- **Out of Scope is mandatory**: Explicitly listing what is NOT in scope is as important as listing what is. It prevents scope creep during implementation.
- **Purpose**: The PRD will be used by a developer agent to create an ADR, and then to implement the application. Write for that audience.

## PRD Template

```markdown
# PRD — [Product / Feature Name]

---

## 1. Executive Summary

2-3 sentences. What is being built, for whom, and what problem it solves. This is a PoC/MVP/feature — state it.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

What problem exists today. Why it matters. What the user currently has to do instead. No solution here — only the problem.

---

## 3. Users / Personas

2-3 concrete personas. For each: who they are, what they want to do, what they expect from the outcome.

---

## 4. Main Flows

One subsection per scenario (happy path + key alternative paths). Step-by-step numbered list. Include what the system does at each step, not just what the user does.

---

## 5. User Stories

Format: "As [who], I want [what], so that [why]."

Minimum 4 user stories. Cover:
- Happy path (main scenario)
- Error cases (invalid input, service unavailable, ambiguous result)
- Session/state scenarios (if applicable)

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

Group by area (Form, AI Decision, Chat, Session, General, etc.).
Each criterion is prefixed AC-XX and is a single, testable, measurable statement.
Do not use subjective language.

---

## 7. Out of Scope

Explicit list of what is NOT being built. Use bold headers for each item.
Include: auth, integrations, admin UI, notifications, multilingual support, mobile apps, etc. — whatever does not apply.

---

## 8. Constraints

### Business
Policy, legal, or operational constraints the product must respect.

### Functional
Concrete limits: file size, accepted formats, number of items, supported browsers/devices, language, etc.

### External document / data references (if applicable)
If the product uses external files (policy docs, knowledge base, etc.), list them in a table: document name | file path | when it is used.

---

## 9. UI Description (wireframe level)

One subsection per screen. Describe:
- What the user sees (layout structure, key elements)
- What each interactive element does
- Error states and empty states
- Loading states
- Navigation between screens

No visual design details (colors, fonts, spacing). Functional and UX detail only.

---

## 10. User Flow Diagram

Mermaid flowchart covering all main flows from Section 4, including branching and error paths.

    ...
```

---

## 11. Agent / System Behavior Specification (if applicable)

Include this section if the product involves an AI agent, LLM, or automated decision system.

- Role and purpose of the agent
- What the agent is allowed to do and what it is NOT allowed to do
- Decision categories and how each should be communicated
- Mandatory disclaimers or legal notices the agent must always include
- How the agent should handle off-topic questions or out-of-scope requests
- Language and tone requirements

---

## 12. Further Notes (optional)

Any open questions, assumptions made, or decisions deferred to a later stage.
